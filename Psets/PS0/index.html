    <h2> Sensing </h2>
    <p>
      This robot senses its environment and the people around it using a multitude of sensors, including LiDAR (the metal cylinder mounted on its front).
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2> Planning </h2>
    <p>
      To successfully execute a walking gate, this robot must utilize the data it has collected about its environment, taking into account the terrain, obstacles, and its desired path to determine where and how it should place each leg.
    </p>

    <br />
    <h2> Acting </h2>
    <p>
      Once a trajectory has been planned, this robot must command each of its actuators in the legs to follow the calculated plan.
